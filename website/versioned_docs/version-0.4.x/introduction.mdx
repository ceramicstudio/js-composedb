## Overview
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3 app developers:

-  **Graph database** - Store and query data from a powerful graph, similar to Neo4j’s property graph database
-  **Easy to use** – Write your models as GraphQL schemas and connect your app using intuitive GraphQL APIs
-  **Data composability** – Reuse models from the marketplace to bootstrap your app with data, unlocking limitless data composability within ComposeDB’s open data ecosystem.
-  **Sign in with Web3** – Securely authenticate users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.
-  **Powered by Ceramic** – ComposeDB is built on Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality.

> For a complete introduction to ComposeDB concepts, see [Core Concepts](./core-concepts).

## Build powerful Web3 applications
ComposeDB on Ceramic powers Web3 applications and use cases, such as:

- Decentralized identity – profiles, credentials, reputation systems
- Social networks – social graphs, posts, likes, comments
- DAO tools – proposals, tasks, contribution graphs
- Information graphs – knowledge graphs, science graphs
- … and so much more

### Project Status: `Beta`

ComposeDB officially entered `Beta` on February 28, 2023. What does this mean?

- You can now build and deploy apps to production on mainnet! 
- Core features like GraphQL APIs, reusable models, and data composability are available
- We will continue to improve performance and add more features
- We are not yet guaranteeing a 100% stable, bug-free platform

If you want to provide feedback, request new features, or report insufficient performance, please [make a post on the Forum](https://forum.ceramic.network/c/graph/9), as we'd like to work with you.
Thank you for being a ComposeDB pioneer and understanding that great Web3 protocols take time to mature.
