ComposeDB is a composable graph database built on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network), designed for Web3 applications. 

### Use Cases
| Use Case  | Examples  |
|---|---|
|__Decentralized identity__| `user profiles` `credentials` `reputation systems` |
|__Web3 social__| `social graphs` `posts` `reactions` `comments` `messages` |
|__DAO tools__| `proposals` `projects` `tasks` `votes` `contribution graphs` |
|__Open information graphs__| `DeSci graphs` `knowledge graphs` `discourse graphs` |

### Why ComposeDB?

-  Store and query data with powerful, easy-to-use GraphQL APIs
-  Build faster with a catalog of plug-and-play schemas
-  Bootstrap content by plugging into a composable data ecosystem
-  Deliver great UX with sign-in with Ethereum, Solana, and more
-  Eliminate trust and guarantee data verifiability
-  Scale your Web3 data infrastructure beyond L1 or L2 blockchains

### Project Status: `Beta`

ComposeDB officially entered `Beta` on February 28, 2023. What does this mean?

- You can now build and deploy apps to production on mainnet! 
- Core features like GraphQL APIs, reusable models, and data composability are available
- We will continue to improve performance and add more features
- We are not yet guaranteeing a 100% stable, bug-free platform

If you want to provide feedback, request new features, or report insufficient performance, please [make a post on the Forum](https://forum.ceramic.network/c/graph/9), as we'd like to work with you.
Thank you for being a ComposeDB pioneer and understanding that great Web3 protocols take time to mature.
