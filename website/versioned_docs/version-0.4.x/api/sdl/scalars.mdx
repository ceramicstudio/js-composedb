Scalars represent the leaf values in the graph, either as part of key-value
properties in shapes, or value of items in lists. You can learn more about
scalars in the
[GraphQL specification](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types).

## Primitive types

The following scalars are part of the
[GraphQL specification](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types).

### `Boolean`

A `true` or `false` value.

### `Int`

A signed 32-bit integer.

A range of valid values can be defined using
[the `@int` directive](./directives.mdx#int).

### `Float`

A signed double-precision floating-point value.

A range of valid values can be defined using
[the `@float` directive](./directives.mdx#float).

### `String`

A UTF-8 character sequence.

:::caution

The [`@string` directive](./directives.mdx#string) **must be used** along with
`String` scalars to define the `maxLength` of the string.

:::

## Identifiers

The following scalars represent unique identifiers in the graph. In ComposedDB,
they are all stored as string values.

### `ID`

A Node identifier used by GraphQL.

:::tip

By default, IDs are configured with a `maxLength` of `100`. The
[`@string` directive](./directives.mdx#string) can be used along with `ID`
scalars to define a different `maxLength` as needed.

:::

### `DID`

A Decentralized Identifier, representing an actor able to create and mutate
Documents in the graph, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/did).

### `StreamID`

Identifies a specific Stream in the Ceramic network, following the
[StreamID specification](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-59/CIP-59.md#streamid).

### `CommitID`

Identifies a specific version of a Stream in the Ceramic network, following the
[CommitID specification](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-59/CIP-59.md#commitid).

### `CID`

A Content Identifier, as used by
[IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#what-is-a-cid).

### `ChainID`

A Chain Agnostic Chain Identifier, as
[specified by Chain Agnostic CAIP-2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md).

### `AccountID`

A Chain Agnostic Account Identifier, as
[specified by Chain Agnostic CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md).

### `URI`

RFC 3986 compliant URI string, such as `https://ceramic.network`.

## Date and time

The following scalars can be used to store date and time values using standard
representations.

### `Date`

RFC 3339 compliant date string without time information, such as `2007-12-03`,
using [GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/date).

### `DateTime`

A date-time string at UTC, such as `2007-12-03T10:15:30Z`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/date-time).

### `Time`

A time string at UTC, such as `10:15:30Z`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/time).

### `LocalDate`

A local date string (with no associated timezone) in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, such
as `2007-12-03`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/local-date).

### `LocalTime`

A local time string (i.e., with no associated timezone) in 24-hr
`HH:mm[:ss[.SSS]]` format, such as `14:25`, `14:25:06` or `14:25:06.123`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/local-time).

### `TimeZone`

Standard IANA time zone, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/scalars/docs/scalars/time-zone).

### `UTCOffset`

A string with format `±hh: mm`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/utc-offset).

### `Duration`

ISO 8601 duration string, such as `P1W1DT13H23M34S`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://www.graphql-scalars.dev/docs/scalars/duration).

## Geography and internationalization

### `Latitude`

Decimal degrees latitude number, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/scalars/docs/scalars/latitude).

### `Longitude`

Decimal degrees longitude number, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/scalars/docs/scalars/longitude).

### `CountryCode`

ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code string, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/scalars/docs/scalars/country-code).

### `Locale`

RFC 5646 locale string, such as `en-GB`, using
[GraphQL Scalars](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/scalars/docs/scalars/locale).
