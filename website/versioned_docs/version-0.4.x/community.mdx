### Partner Guides
- Check out [Daoism Systems' guide](https://daoismsystems.notion.site/Setting-up-a-decentralized-Safe-registry-with-ComposeDB-01aad3c49eba4f90a8648dcd83f9dd6e) to working with their models on ComposeDB

### Ecosystem Grants
If you’re interested in a grant feel free to reach out in the #bounties channel. We welcome all submissions, but we’re especially looking for contributions in the following areas:

| Idea  | Description  |
|---|---|
|__Catalog GUI__| Wouldn’t it be great if developers could access the [model catalog](./guides/data-modeling/model-catalog.mdx) with a UI instead of the CLI? |
|__Sample Apps & Models__| Inspire other developers by building sample apps & data models, like reputation credentials, social apps, or DAO tools. |
|__Easy Node Setup__| Make it easy to deploy ComposeDB on a node - we wrote a [proof of concept](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ceramic-infra-poc) you can build on. Bonus: Terraform templates for cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean. |
|__Config Script__| We’d love to make [Set up your environment](./set-up-your-environment.mdx) even easier. Want to create a lightning fast script? |
