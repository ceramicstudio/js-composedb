# Running Locally
Run a ComposeDB server on your local machine, e.g. your laptop

## Things to Know
- ComposeDB requires running a Ceramic node (which uses IPFS) for decentralized data and a SQL instance for your index database.
- ComposeDB server can also be run locally [using Docker](../../guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud.mdx).

:::tip

If you want to serve a live application in production, see [Running in the Cloud](../../guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud.mdx).

:::

## Requirements
**Runtime**
- Node.js Version 16

**Package Manager**
- npm Version 6

**xupported Operating Systems**
- Linux
- Mac
- Windows

:::note

For Windows, Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is strongly recommended. Using the Windows command line is not portable and can cause compatibility issue when running the same configuration on a different operating system (e.g. in a Linux-based cloud deployment).

## Installation
### Using npm

Install the Ceramic CLI and ComposeDB CLI using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli @composedb/cli
```

## Basic Setup
### Admin account
If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create an admin account (DID) to handle restricted changes and admin operations on your node. To do so, follow the  steps in [Set up your environment](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx#developer-account) to generate a key & account. Once you’ve added your admin DID to the config file, return here.

### Start the daemon
Using a command line utility or terminal, start the Ceramic daemon: 

```bash
ceramic daemon
```

## Configurations
You now have a server running with the default configuration and a preconfigured IPFS node that can be used by the [ComposeDB Client](../../guides/composedb-client/composedb-client.mdx). 

## Next Steps
Edit your [Server Configurations](../../guides/composedb-server/server-configurations.mdx) for your use case.
