# Introduction to Modeling
Learn the basics of creating a new data model.

## Setup
Create a new `.graphql` file in your project directory to store your model(s). 

For example, let’s create a file called `my-schema.graphql`. Inside, we’re going to create a model to store a very simple user profile:

```graphql
type SimpleProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "Very basic profile") {
  displayName: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 50)
}
```

## Metadata
Let’s look into the metadata properties of your new model:

```graphql
type SimpleProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "Very basic profile")
```

Where:

- `type` defines the name for your model, in our case `SimpleProfile`
- `@createModel` is a directive that specifies we are creating a new model
- `accountRelation` defines the allowable number of instances per account, where `SINGLE` limits one instance per account, and `LIST` allows unlimited instances per account
- `description` is a string that describes the model

Model names and descriptions are used in the [Model Catalog](./model-catalog.mdx). Aim for short and descriptive to improve discovery and reuse.

## Schema
Model schemas are written using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). Let’s look at the schema of our new model. It’s a shape that only defines a single field (key) and scalar (value):

```graphql
{
  displayName: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 50)
}
```

Where:

- `displayName` is a field
- `String!` is a scalar that defines `displayName` is a required (`!`) string
- `@string` is a directive that sets validation rules for the scalar, in our case min and max length

This is a very basic schema, but your schemas can contain more than one field and include various relations - see [Schemas](./schemas.mdx).

## Next Steps
To use your new model in your application, you will need to create a [**Composite →**](./composites.mdx)
