# Composites

Guides for creating, deploying, and using composites.

## Overview

In order to start using a new model in your application, first you’ll have to include it within a composite. Composites are collections of one or more models and represent the complete GraphQL schema for your application.

## Prerequisites

- If you want to manage your composites from the CLI, you will need to have it installed
- If you want to manage your composites from JavaScript, you will need to install the [`@composedb/devtools`](../../api/modules/devtools.md) library
- One or more `.graphql` files containing your models

## Basic Usage

For basic composite usage, you will need one or more models. If you don't have a model deployed, then see [Creating Models](#creating_models). To use your composite, follow these steps:

1. Create a composite
2. Deploy the composite to your node
3. Compile the composite for usage

:::tip

For advanced usage such as merging, extracting or inspecting composites, see [Advanced](#advanced) below.

### Creating Models
Let's say you have a model as in [Schemas](schemas.mdx). You will first save that model to a graphql file, `education_module.graphql`. You can then create your model with

    composedb composite:create education_module.graphql --output=education_module.json --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007

You can then output the json to find the model id, or pass it through jq to locate

    cat education_module.json | jq.models[keys_unsorted[0]]

:::caution Private key required

Running this command requires a DID private key to be provided, 
using the `DID_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable or the `--did-private-key` flag.


### Creating Composites

Let’s say you have a model written in a `my-schema.graphql` file. To convert this schema into a composite, run the following:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
composedb composite:create my-schema.graphql --output=my-composite.json --did-private-key=your-private-key
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

// Import the devtool node package
import { createComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

// Hexadecimal-encoded private key for a DID having admin access to the target Ceramic node
// Replace the example key here by your admin private key
const privateKey = fromString('b0cb[...]515f', 'base16')

const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the Models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
// An authenticated DID with admin access must be set on the Ceramic instance
ceramic.did = did

// Replace by the path to the source schema file
const composite = await createComposite(ceramic, './source-schema.graphql')

// Replace by the path to the encoded composite file
await writeEncodedComposite(composite, './my-composite.json')
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a file called `my-composite.json` which contains the composite in JSON.

### Deploying composites

After creating the composite, deploy it to your local node:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
composedb composite:deploy my-composite.json --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --did-private-key=your-private-key
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

import { readEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

// Hexadecimal-encoded private key for a DID having admin access to the target Ceramic node
// Replace the example key here by your admin private key
const privateKey = fromString('b0cb[...]515f', 'base16')

const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the Models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
// An authenticated DID with admin access must be set on the Ceramic instance
ceramic.did = did

// Replace by the path to the local encoded composite file
const composite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'my-first-composite.json')

// Notify the Ceramic node to index the models present in the composite
await composite.startIndexingOn(ceramic)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will also automatically add all models contained in the composite to the [Model Catalog](./model-catalog.mdx).

### Compiling composites

After deploying your composite, compile it so you can start perform [Data Interactions](../../guides/data-interactions/data-interactions.mdx) using the [ComposeDB Client](../../guides/composedb-client/composedb-client.mdx)

```bash
composedb composite:compile my-first-composite.json runtime-composite.json
```

To compile your composite for import and use with the [JavasScript Client](../../guides/composedb-client/javascript-client.mdx), just specify an output file ending in .js

```bash
composedb composite:compile my-first-composite.json runtime-composite.js
```

## Advanced

### Merging composites

If you have more than one composite, you need to merge them into a single composite for use in your app. This may apply when:

- You want to use multiple models from the [catalog](./model-catalog.mdx#using-multiple-models)
- You want to use a model from the catalog and one or more models you created
- You create multiple models and store their schemas in different GraphQL files

Let’s say you have two composites where `simple-profile-composite.json` contains the model for a profile model and `post-composite.json` contains the model for a post. To merge, reference both composite JSON files and specify an output file path for the merged composite.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
composedb composite:merge simple-profile-composite.json post-composite.json --output=merged-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')

const loadSources = ['simple-profile-composite.json', 'post-composite.json'].map(
  async (path) => await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, path)
)
const sourceComposites = await Promise.all(loadSources)
const mergedComposite = Composite.from(sourceComposites)

await writeEncodedComposite(mergedComposite, 'merged-composite.json')
```

:::caution
**_Note:_** To run the code above, you need a Ceramic JS HTTP client library installed on your machine to connect your app to a Ceramic node. Ceramic JS HTTP client can be installed by running the following command:

`pnpm install @ceramicnetwork/http-client`

:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output of either example is a new file named `merged-composite.json` which contains the models of both merged composites. From here you need to [deploy](#deploying-composites) the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it.

### Extracting composites

In cases where your composite contain models not needed by your application, or in other cases where you generally want to separate models in your composite, you can extract models into a separate composite.

As an example, let’s reuse the `merged-composite.json` file from the previous section and assume you want to extract the profile model into a separate composite. To do this, load the `merged-composite.json` file and specify which model(s) you’d like to extract into a new composite file.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
composedb composite:extract-model merged-composite.json kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9 --output=new-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
const sourceComposite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'merged-composite.json')

const mergedComposite = sourceComposite.copy([
  'kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9',
])
await writeEncodedComposite(mergedComposite, 'new-composite.json')
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a file called `new-composite.json` with your profile model in it. From here you need to deploy the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it.

### Inspecting composites

If you want to check what models are included in a specific composite, follow the steps below:

1. Compile the composite:
   `composedb composite:compile my-first-composite.json runtime-composite.json`

2. View the GraphQL schema of the composite:
   [`composedb graphql:schema runtime-composite.json --output=schema.graphql`](../../api/commands/cli.graphql.md#composedb-graphqlschema)

### Aliasing composites

In general, models are referenced using their unique model streamIDs which are not memorable. Models can be more easily referenced by aliasing them to your preferred names.

To manually set aliases for your models, add the following section to your composite JSON file. In this case we will use the aliases `SimpleProfile` and `Post`.

```jsx
"aliases":{
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9":"SimpleProfile",
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96":"Post"
   }
```

To do aliases programmatically, use the ComposeDB Devtools library. Here’s an example script that loads a composite JSON file and assigns `SimpleProfile` and `Post`:

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
const sourceComposite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'merged-composite.json')

const newComposite = sourceComposite.setAliases({
  kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9: 'SimpleProfile',
  kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96: 'Post',
})
await writeEncodedComposite(newComposite, 'new-composite.json')
```

This script will create a file named `new-composite.json` including model aliases:

```jsx
"aliases":{
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c5ajfmes842lu09vjxu5956e3xq0xk12gp2jcf9s90cagt2god9":"SimpleProfile",
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96":"Post"
   }
```

From here you need to [deploy](#deploying-composites) the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it. When interacting with the models inside your app, you can refer to them using their human-readable aliases rather than their streamIDs.
