# Using Relay GraphQL Client
[Relay](https://relay.dev/) is a popular GraphQL client for React.

## Prerequisites
- Install the [`composedb`](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx) packages
- Install the `relay-runtime`package
- A compiled composite

## Usage
The ComposeDB client can be used with Relay by creating a custom [network layer](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/network-layer/), as shown:

```jsx
import { ComposeClient } from '@composedb/client'
import { Environment, Network, RecordSource, Store } from 'relay-runtime'

// Path to compiled composite
import { definition } from './__generated__/definition.js'

const compose = new ComposeClient({ ceramic: 'http://localhost:7007', definition })

// Create custom Network using ComposeClient instance to execute operations
const network = Network.create(async (request, variables) => {
  return await client.executeQuery(request.text, variables)
})

// Use created Network instance to create Relay Environment
export const environment = new Environment({ network, store: new Store(new RecordSource()) })
```
