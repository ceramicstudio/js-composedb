# Graph
ComposeDB provides a **graph structure** for interacting with data on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/). The ComposeDB content graph supports two types of nodes: **accounts** that are able to able to create & edit data in the graph, and **documents** containing mutable data of a given shape.

The **nodes** in the graph can be **accounts** or **documents**, while the **edges** in the graph represent relations between **nodes**. All nodes in the ComposeDB graph use a globally unique identifier, allowing direct access to any known node.

ComposeDB is is designed similar to a property graph database.

## Accounts

Ceramic uses [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) for [Authentication](./guides/composedb-client/user-sessions), which get translated to [`CeramicAccount` objects](./guides/data-interactions/queries#ceramicaccount-object) by the ComposeDB client.

DIDs can represent any entity that is able to write data on Ceramic and therefore in ComposeDB, which can be end-users of an application, groups, applications or any kind of authenticated service.

In order to write or [mutate data](./guides/data-interactions/mutations)  within ComposeDB, a DID must be authorized within the client instance.

## Documents

Documents are [Ceramic streams](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/advanced/overview/#streams) that store structured data as defined by a [model](./guides/data-modeling/introduction-to-modeling).

Ceramic nodes can be configured to index specific models, storing all the documents using a model in a local database in order to provide fast access and query capabilities.

Using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), the ComposeDB client allows to query documents indexed by a Ceramic node, as well as creating new documents and updating existing ones when [mutations](./guides/data-interactions/mutations) are enabled.
