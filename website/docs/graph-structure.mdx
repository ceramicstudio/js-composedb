# Graph
ComposeDB provides a **graph structure** for interacting with data on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/). The ComposeDB content graph supports two types of nodes: **accounts** that are able to able to create & edit data in the graph, and **documents** containing mutable data of a given shape.

The **nodes** in the graph can be **accounts** or **documents**, while the **edges** in the graph represent relations between **nodes**. All nodes in the ComposeDB graph use a globally unique identifier, allowing direct access to any known node.

ComposeDB is is designed similar to a property graph database.

## Accounts

Ceramic uses [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) for accounts, which get translated to CeramicAccount objects by the ComposeDB client.

DIDs can represent any entity that is able to write data on Ceramic and therefore in ComposeDB, which can be end-users of an application, groups, applications or any kind of authenticated service.

In order to write data in DB, a DID must be attached to the client instance. <!-- , as documented in the [mutations page](../0.3.x/guides/interacting/mutations). -->

## Documents

Documents are [Ceramic streams](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/advanced/overview/#streams) that store structured data as defined by a model.

Ceramic nodes can be configured to index specific models, storing all the documents using a model in a local database in order to provide fast access and query capabilities.

Using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), the ComposeDB client allows to query documents indexed by a Ceramic node, as well as creating new documents and updating existing ones when mutations are enabled. <!-- [mutations are enabled](../0.3.x/guides/interacting/mutations). -->
