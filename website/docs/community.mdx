## Ways to Contribute
### Ecosystem Grants
If you’re interested in a grant feel free to reach out in the #bounties channel. We welcome all submissions, but we’re especially looking for contributions in the following areas:

- **Marketplace GUI:** Wouldn’t it be great if developers could access the composite marketplace with an app UI instead of a terminal?
- **Sample Apps & Models:** Inspire other developers by building sample apps & data models, like reputation credentials, social apps, or DAO tools.
- **Easy Node Setup:** Make it easy to deploy ComposeDB on a node - we wrote a [proof of concept](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ceramic-infra-poc) you can build on. Bonus: Terraform templates for cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean.
- **Config Script:** We’d love to make [Set up your environment](./set-up-your-environment.mdx) even easier. Want to create a lightning fast script?

### **Open source contributions**
Contribute to the [ComposeDB repository](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-composedb): here are some packages to get started
- [composedb/client](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-composedb/tree/main/packages/client)
- [composedb/cli](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-composedb/tree/main/packages/cli)
We recommend getting in touch on the [#ComposeDB](https://discord.gg/6FCS44YDBs) Discord channel before diving in.
