# Schemas
Learn how to write high-quality GraphQL schemas for your models.

## Overview
ComposeDB models are written in GraphQL using GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). Your schema defines a collection of object types and the relationships between them. Those types will have scalars (values), shapes (key-value mappings), and [lists](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/guides/creating-composites/schema#shapes-and-lists) to describe the structure and validation rules for the model, and use [directives](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/guides/creating-composites/schema#directives) for other metadata information.

We currently support a subset of SDL’s scalars and directives, but are continually adding more, see the [reference](../../api/sdl/scalars) for a complete list.

On this page, we provide basic info for you to begin writing GraphQL data models. For more complete information on the GraphQL Schema Definition Language, visit the [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

### Shapes, Fields, Scalars
The most basic component in a GraphQL schema is an object type, sometimes called a shape. It simply represents the shape of the data you want to query and its properties, consisting of fields (keys) and scalars (values).

```graphql
type EducationModule {
	module_name: String!
	module_domain: String
	number_of_topics_covered: Int!
	learners_enrolled: [Learner!]!
}
```

Where:

- `type` defines a new object
- `EducationModule` the name given to the object; queryable
- `module_name`, `module_domain`, `number_of_topics_covered` and `learners_enrolled` are fields in the `EducationModule` type; all fields are queryable
- `String!` and `Int!` define the data type of the value. By adding `!` to the end of the type declaration, we are telling GraphQL to always return a value when we query this field, which also means that when writing data through a mutation a value is required.
- `[Learner!]!` defines the data type of the value, but in this case the data type is an array of another type, `Learner`, which is not depicted above. It is required since it includes the `!`.

### Special Types

GraphQL reserves the use of two special type names, `query` and `mutation`. 

*Do not* name any of your own custom types, which are the majority of the types you will work with, the same as these two special types.

- `query` type is used as the entry point when retrieving data using GraphQL
- `mutation` type is used as the entry point when writing or changing data using GraphQL

You will see more about these special types when you reach the module on **CRUD Operations**. 

### Embedded Shapes

Our first shape, `EducationModule`, makes use of an embedded shape called `Learner`:

```graphql
type EducationModule {
	module_name: String!
	module_domain: String
	number_of_topics_covered: Int!
	learners_enrolled: [Learner!]!
}

type Learner {
	first_name: String!
	last_name: String!
	username: String!
}
```

`Learner` is not anything different from `EducationModule` in terms of how it is defined. It does contain different fields, but it is just a GraphQL shape that can be used like any other shape.

💡 For this to work, you will want to define both shapes inside the same GraphQL file when writing ComposeDB schemas.

### Directives

Directives are keywords that help add validation rules to a scalar. Not all scalars need to have directives. Let’s add directives to the two shapes used in this guide:

```graphql
type EducationModule {
	module_name: String! @string(maxLength: 50)
	module_domain: String @string(minLength: 5)
	number_of_topics_covered: Int! @int(min: 1, max: 100
	learners_enrolled: [Learner!]! @list(maxLength: 30)
}

type Learner {
	first_name: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 30)
	last_name: String!
	username: String!
}
```

Where:

- Each directive is declared using the `@` symbol
- `@string` adds validation rules to values that are strings, e.g. minimum and maximum length
- `@int` adds validation rules to values that are integers, e.g. minimum and maximum values
- `@list` adds validation rules to an array, e.g. maximum length
