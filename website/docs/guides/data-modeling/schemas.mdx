# Schemas

Learn how to write high-quality GraphQL schemas for your models.

## Overview

ComposeDB models are written in GraphQL using GraphQL Schema Definition Language [(SDL)](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/). Your schema defines a collection of object types and the relationships between them. Those types will have scalars (values), shapes (key-value mappings), and lists to describe the structure and validation rules for the model, and use directives for other metadata information.

We currently support a subset of SDL’s scalars and directives, but are continually adding more, see the [reference](../../api/sdl/scalars.mdx) for a complete list.

## Concepts

On this page, we provide basic info for you to begin writing GraphQL data models. For more complete information on the GraphQL Schema Definition Language, visit the [GraphQL website](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

### Shapes, Fields, Scalars

The most basic component in a GraphQL schema is an object type, sometimes called a shape. It simply represents the shape of the data you want to query and its properties, consisting of fields (keys) and scalars (values).

```graphql
type EducationModule {
  module_name: String!
  module_domain: String
  number_of_topics_covered: Int!
  learners_enrolled: [Learner!]!
}
```

Where:

- `type` defines a new object
- `EducationModule` the name given to the object; queryable
- `module_name`, `module_domain`, `number_of_topics_covered` and `learners_enrolled` are fields in the `EducationModule` type; all fields are queryable
- `String!` and `Int!` define the data type of the value. By adding `!` to the end of the type declaration, we are telling GraphQL to always return a value when we query this field, which also means that when writing data through a mutation a value is required.
- `[Learner!]!` defines the data type of the value, but in this case the data type is an array of another type, `Learner`, which is not depicted above. It is required since it includes the `!`.

### Enums

Enums represent the type of a single string value in the schema from a set of
accepted values, for example:

```graphql
enum NoteStatus {
  DEFAULT
  IMPORTANT
  ARCHIVE
}
```

### Special Types

GraphQL reserves the use of two special type names, `query` and `mutation`.

_Do not_ name any of your own custom types, which are the majority of the types you will work with, the same as these two special types.

- `query` type is used as the entry point when retrieving data using GraphQL
- `mutation` type is used as the entry point when writing or changing data using GraphQL

### Embedded Shapes

Our first shape, `EducationModule`, makes use of an embedded shape called `Learner`:

```graphql
type EducationModule {
  module_name: String!
  module_domain: String
  number_of_topics_covered: Int!
  learners_enrolled: [Learner!]!
}

type Learner {
  first_name: String!
  last_name: String!
  username: String!
}
```

`Learner` is not anything different from `EducationModule` in terms of how it is defined. It does contain different fields, but it is just a GraphQL shape that can be used like any other shape.

💡 For this to work, you will want to define both shapes inside the same GraphQL file when writing ComposeDB schemas. 

### Directives

ComposeDB comes with [a list of different directives](../../api/sdl/directives.mdx) that can be used to create or load data models, define type validation rules, and create indices 
for specific fields which enables them to be used for document filtering and sorting. 

#### Type validation directives

Directives are keywords that add validation rules to a scalar. Not all scalars need to have directives, though Strings are required to have a maxLength. Let’s add directives to the two shapes used in this guide:

```graphql
type EducationModule {
	module_name: String! @string(maxLength: 50)
	module_domain: String @string(minLength: 5, maxLength: 50)
	number_of_topics_covered: Int! @int(min: 1, max: 100)
	learners_enrolled: [Learner!]! @list(maxLength: 30)
}

type Learner {
	first_name: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 30)
	last_name: String! @string(maxLength: 30) 
	username: String! @string(maxLength: 32)
}
```

Where:

- Each directive is declared using the `@` symbol
- `@string` adds validation rules to values that are strings, e.g. minimum and maximum length
- `@int` adds validation rules to values that are integers, e.g. minimum and maximum values
- `@list` adds validation rules to an array, e.g. maximum length


#### Directives for creating indices 

To be able to filter the query results by a specific field and sort them in a specific order, 
you are required to create indices for corresponding fields. In ComposeDB indices work the 
same way as in traditional databases - they speed up querying processes. You can create indices 
for specific fields using `@createIndex` directive as follows:

```graphql
type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "title"}])
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "tag"}])
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "created_at"}])
{
    title: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    ranking: Int!
    created_at: DateTime!
}
```

The example above will create indices for the fields `title`, `tag` and `created_at`, and will enable you to filter the documents based on the values in these fields as well as sort the results in a specified order. 

You can create indices for individual or multiple fields in your data models.
