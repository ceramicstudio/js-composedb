# Model Catalog
Discover, share, and reuse data models.

## Overview
The catalog is a free and open source repository of all data models created by the ComposeDB developer community. The catalog aims to make it as easy as possible for developers to discover, share, and reuse each others models and underlying data.

### Use Cases

- Discover high-quality models for your app
- Share and distribute your models to others

## Adding Models
Models in all deployed composites are automatically available on the catalog. See Deploying Composites.

How it works:

1. A developer deploys [Composites](./composites) containing models to testnet or mainnet
2. An indexer builds a catalog of all deployed models and exposes it via API
3. The catalog is automatically available on various interfaces, including ComposeDB CLI

## Using Models

### Prerequisites

You need a running instance of ComposeDB to use the catalog. See [Set up your environment](../../set-up-your-environment) to get started.

### List all models

Using ComposeDB CLI, run the following command to list all models:

```sh
composedb model:list --table
```

You will see a table where each model has the following metadata properties:

- `Name` - name of the model
- `ID` - unique identifier (streamID) of the model
- `Description` - description of the model

### Using a single model
Fetch a single model from the catalog and convert it into a composite, using its model ID:

```sh
composedb composite:from-model kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc --output=my-composite.json
```

### Using multiple models
Run the `composite:from-model` command depicted above for each model you want to use in your application. Remember to change the composite file name to avoid collisions. After you have multiple composite files, merge them. See Merging Composites.

## Next Steps
To use your newly created composite in your app, you will need to deploy and compile your composite.
