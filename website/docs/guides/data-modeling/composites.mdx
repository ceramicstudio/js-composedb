# Composites
Guides for creating, deploying, and using composites.

## Overview
In order to start using a new model in your application, first you’ll have to convert it into a composite. Composites are collections of one or more models and represent the complete GraphQL schema for your application.

## Prerequisites
- If you want to manage your composites from the CLI, you will need to have it installed
- If you want to manage your composites from JavaScript, you will need to install the [`@composedb/devtools`](../../api/modules/devtools) library
- One or more `.graphql` files containing your models

## Basic Usage
For basic composite usage, you will need one or more models. Then follow these steps:

1. Create a composite
2. Deploy the composite to your node
3. Compile the composite for usage

For advanced usage such as merging, extracting or inspecting composites, see [Advanced](#advanced) below.

### Creating composites
Let’s say you have a model written in a `my-schema.graphql` file. To convert this model into a composite, run the following:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```sh
composedb composite:create my-schema.graphql --output=my-composite.json --did-private-key=your-private-key
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

// Import the devtool node package
import { createComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

// Hexadecimal-encoded private key for a DID having admin access to the target Ceramic node
// Replace the example key here by your admin private key
const privateKey = fromString('b0cb[...]515f', 'base16')

const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the Models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
// An authenticated DID with admin access must be set on the Ceramic instance
ceramic.did = did

// Replace by the path to the source schema file
const composite = await createComposite(ceramic, './source-schema.graphql')

// Replace by the path to the encoded composite file
await writeEncodedComposite(composite, './my-composite.json')
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a file called `my-composite.json` which contains the composite in JSON. 

### Deploying composites
After creating the composite, deploy it to your local node: 

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```sh
composedb composite:deploy my-composite.json --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --did-private-key=your-private-key
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

import { readEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

// Hexadecimal-encoded private key for a DID having admin access to the target Ceramic node
// Replace the example key here by your admin private key
const privateKey = fromString('b0cb[...]515f', 'base16')

const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the Models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
// An authenticated DID with admin access must be set on the Ceramic instance
ceramic.did = did

// Replace by the path to the local encoded composite file
const composite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'my-first-composite.json')

// Notify the Ceramic node to index the models present in the composite
await composite.startIndexingOn(ceramic)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will also automatically add all models contained in the composite to the [Model Catalog](./model-catalog). 

### Compiling composites
After deploying your composite, compile it so you can start interacting with data:

```sh
composedb composite:compile my-first-composite.json runtime-composite.json
```

## Advanced
### Merging composites

If you have more than one composite, you need to merge them into a single composite for use in your app. This may apply when:

- You want to use multiple models from the [catalog](./model-catalog#using-multiple-models)
- You want to use a model from the catalog and one or more models you created
- You create multiple models and store their schemas in different GraphQL files

Let’s say you have two composites where `simple-profile-composite.json` contains the model for a profile model and `post-composite.json` contains the model for a post. To merge, reference both composite JSON files and specify an output file path for the merged composite. 

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```sh
composedb composite:merge simple-profile-composite.json post-composite.json --output=merged-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')

const loadSources = [
  'simple-profile-composite.json',
  'post-composite.json',
].map(async (path) => await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, path))
const sourceComposites = await Promise.all(loadSources)
const mergedComposite = Composite.from(sourceComposites)

await writeEncodedComposite(mergedComposite, 'merged-composite.json')
```

:::caution
***Note:*** To run the code above, you need a Ceramic JS HTTP client library installed on your machine to connect your app to a Ceramic node. Ceramic JS HTTP client can be installed by running the following command:

`pnpm install @ceramicnetwork/http-client`[](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/api/commands/cli.graphql#composedb-graphqlschema)

</Tabs>

The output of either example is a new file named `merged-composite.json` which contains the models of both merged composites. From here you need to [deploy](#deploying-composites) the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it. 

### Extracting composites
In cases where your composite contain models not needed by your application, or in other cases where you generally want to separate models in your composite, you can extract models into a separate composite. 

As an example, let’s reuse the `merged-composite.json` file from the previous section and assume you want to extract the profile model into a separate composite. To do this, load the `merged-composite.json` file and specify which model(s) you’d like to extract into a new composite file.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  groupId="cli-or-js"
  values={[
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```sh
composedb composite:extract-model merged-composite.json kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc --output=new-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
const sourceComposite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'merged-composite.json')

const mergedComposite = sourceComposite.copy(['kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc'])
await writeEncodedComposite(mergedComposite, 'new-composite.json')
```

This will create a file called `new-composite.json` with your profile model in it. From here you need to deploy the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it. 

### Inspecting composites
If you want to check what models are included in a specific composite, follow the steps below:

1. Compile the composite:
`composedb composite:compile my-first-composite.json runtime-composite.json`

2. View the GraphQL schema of the composite:
`composedb graphql:schema runtime-composite.json --output=schema.graphql`[](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/api/commands/cli.graphql#composedb-graphqlschema)

### Aliasing composites
In general, models are referenced using their unique model streamIDs which are not memorable. Models can be more easily referenced by aliasing them to your preferred names. 

To manually set aliases for your models, add the following section to your composite JSON file. In this case we will use the aliases `SimpleProfile` and `Post`.

```jsx
"aliases":{
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc":"SimpleProfile",
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96":"Post"
   }
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


To do aliases programmatically, use the ComposeDB Devtools library. Here’s an example script that loads a composite JSON file and assigns `SimpleProfile` and `Post`:

```jsx
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { readEncodedComposite, writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
const sourceComposite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'merged-composite.json')

const newComposite = sourceComposite.setAliases({
  'kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc': 'SimpleProfile',
  'kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96': 'Post',
})
await writeEncodedComposite(newComposite, 'new-composite.json')
```

This script will create a file named `new-composite.json` including model aliases:

```jsx
"aliases":{
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c7keo17n66rxyo21nqqaa9lh491jz16od43nokz7ksfcvzi6bwc":"SimpleProfile",
      "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96":"Post"
   }
```

From here you need to [deploy](#deploying-composites) the composite to your node, then [compile](#compiling-composites) the composite to start using it. When interacting with the models inside your app, you can refer to them using their human-readable aliases rather than their streamIDs.
