# Data composition

Data composition is at the heart of ComposeDB, using [composites](./concepts-overview.md#composites) as a proxy for datasets of [documents](./concepts-overview.md#documents) relevant to applications and services.

Composites represent sets of [models](./concepts-overview.md#models) that can be used to query, create and update documents, therefore it is important for developers to identify models to use, whether by [reusing models already adopted by the ecosystem](./using-composites/discovery.mdx) in order to access the set of documents already created using these models, or [creating new models](./creating-composites/overview.mdx) that would better suit specific needs.

## Models composition

The following schema describes how composites can be created by [merging existing composites](./using-composites/customization.mdx#merging-composites) (composites `D` and `A'` below) and [extracting models from a composite](./using-composites/customization.mdx#extracting-models) (composites `E` and `F` below).

The same datasets can be represented by different composites, such as the composites `A` and `A'` below that contain the same models.
