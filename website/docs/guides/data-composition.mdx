# Data composition

Data composition is at the heart of ComposeDB, using [composites](./concepts-overview.md#composites) as a proxy for datasets of [documents](./concepts-overview.md#documents) relevant to applications and services.

Composites represent sets of [models](./concepts-overview.md#models) that can be used to query, create and update documents, therefore it is important for developers to identify models to use, whether by [reusing models already adopted by the ecosystem](./using-composites/discovery.mdx) in order to access the set of documents already created using these models, or [creating new models](./creating-composites/overview.mdx) that would better suit specific needs.

## Models composition

The following schema describes how composites can be created by [merging existing composites](./using-composites/customization.mdx#merging-composites) (composites `D` and `A'` below) and [extracting models from a composite](./using-composites/customization.mdx#extracting-models) (composites `E` and `F` below).

The same datasets can be represented by different composites, such as the composites `A` and `A'` below that contain the same models.

## Relations

The ComposeDB graph representation supports the following types of edges (relations) between nodes:

- [Account to document](#account-to-document), with two variants:
  - Single: an [account](./concepts-overview.md#accounts) can only be related to **one** [document](./concepts-overview.md#documents) of a given [model](./concepts-overview.md#models).
  - Multiple: an [account](./concepts-overview.md#accounts) can be related to **many** [documents](./concepts-overview.md#documents) of a given [model](./concepts-overview.md#models).
- [Document to account](#document-to-account): a [document](./concepts-overview.md#documents) can contain properties storing relations to an [account](./concepts-overview.md#accounts).
- [Document to document](#document-to-account): a [document](./concepts-overview.md#documents) can contain properties storing relations to another [document](./concepts-overview.md#documents).

Direct edges between accounts are **not supported** by ComposeDB, but relations can be defined indirectly by using an intermediary [document](./concepts-overview.md#documents).

### Account to document

The relations between documents and the account controlling (having created and being able to update) them are defined in the [model](./concepts-overview.md#models) used by the document.

ComposeDB currently supports two variants for these relations:

#### Account to single document

This variant ensures the indexing service stores **at most one document** of the given model for the account. This can be useful notably to store a profile or similar information.

These relations can be defined when creating new models, using the [`@createModel` directive](./creating-composites/directives.md#createmodel) with the `accountRelation` argument set to `SINGLE`.

#### Account to multiple documents

This variant allows **any number of documents** of a given model to be associated to the account.

These relations can be defined when creating new models, using the [`@createModel` directive](./creating-composites/directives.md#createmodel) with the `accountRelation` argument set to `LIST`.

### Document to account

The ComposeDB runtime logic automatically replaces [`DID` scalars](./creating-composites/scalars.md#did) defined in a schema by [`CeramicAccount` objects](./interacting/queries.md#ceramicaccount-object), allowing to access the documents associated to the given account.

In order to make these fields directly queryable from the index, the schema must use the [`@accountReference` directive](./creating-composites/directives.md#accountreference) on these fields.

### Document to document

Relations between documents can be defined on fields using the [`StreamID` scalar](./creating-composites/scalars.md#streamid) with the [`@documentReference` directive](./creating-composites/directives.md#documentreference) specifying the [model](./concepts-overview.md#models) the related document must use. This allows to define **many-to-one** relations between documents, for example many "comment" documents to a single "post" document.

Using the ComposeDB runtime, the associated document can be accessed directly if a view using the [`@relationDocument` directive](./creating-composites/directives.md#relationdocument) is defined in the model.

It is also possible to represent **one-to-many** relations, for example one "post" document to many "comment" documents, by using the [`@relationFrom`](./creating-composites/directives.md#relationfrom) and [`@relationCountFrom`](./creating-composites/directives.md#relationcountfrom) directives to represent the other side of the relations.
