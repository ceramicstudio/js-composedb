# JavaScript Client
Interact with ComposeDB using JavaScript, TypeScript, or React. 

:::tip
The client exposes the primary APIs to interact with ComposeDB from your application using a [compiled composite](../../guides/data-modeling/composites.mdx#compiling-composites).
:::

## Prerequisites
---
- A compiled composite

## Installation
---
Install the ComposeDB client package:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="npm-or-pnpm-or-yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @composedb/client
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @composedb/client
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @composedb/client
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you’re using TypeScript, you may also need to install ComposeDB Types:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="npm-or-pnpm-or-yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -D @composedb/types
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add -D @composedb/types
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add -D @composedb/types
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Configuration
---
Create a client instance by passing your server URL and your compiled composite:

```jsx
// Import ComposeDB client

import { ComposeClient }from '@composedb/client'

// Import your compiled composite

import { definition }from './__generated__/definition.js'

// Create an instance of ComposeClient
// Pass the URL of your Ceramic server
// Pass reference to your compiled composite

const compose = new ComposeClient({ ceramic: 'http://localhost:7007', definition })

```

More details: [`ComposeClient`](../../api/classes/client.ComposeClient.md)

## Queries
---
### Executing Queries

Execute GraphQL [Queries](../../guides/data-interactions/queries.mdx) using the schema that is auto-generated from your compiled composite:

```jsx
// Get account of authenticated user

await compose.executeQuery(`
  query {
    viewer {
      id
    }
  }
`)

```

More details: [`executeQuery`](../../api/classes/client.ComposeClient.md#executequery)

## Mutations
---
### Enabling Mutations

:::tip
Before enabling mutations you must [authenticate the user](./../composedb-client/authenticate-users.mdx).
:::

After you have an authenticated user, enable [mutations](../../guides/data-interactions/mutations.mdx) by setting their authenticated account on the ComposeDB client:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="with-sessions"
  groupId="with-or-without-sessions"
  values={[
    {label: 'With Sessions', value: 'with-sessions'},
    {label: 'Without Sessions', value: 'without-sessions'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="with-sessions">

```jsx
// Assign the authorized did from your session to your client

compose.setDID(session.did)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="without-sessions">

```jsx
// Call setDID method on ComposeClient instance
// Using authenticated did instance

compose.setDID(did)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Executing mutations
In your client, you can execute GraphQL mutations using the schema that is auto-generated from your compiled composite. Follow examples in the [mutations](../../guides/data-interactions/mutations.mdx) guide.
