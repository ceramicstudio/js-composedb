# Composites deployment

Valid composites can be deployed to any supporting Ceramic node, by ensuring the model streams described in the composite are available on the node, and that the node is configured to index theses models.

## Models deployment

<Tabs
  defaultValue="api"
  groupId="api-or-cli"
  values={[
    {label: 'Using the CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Using the API', value: 'api'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="api">

Make sure you have the `composedb` packages [installed](../../installation.mdx), before running the code below.

```js
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { readEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')

// Replace by the path to the local encoded composite file
const composite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'my-composite.json')

console.log('Model IDs to set in configuration:', composite.modelIDs)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">

First, we need to ensure the model streams are available on the target Ceramic node:

```sh
composedb composite:deploy my-composite.json --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007
```

Then, we need to get the list of models that need to be set for indexing in the Ceramic node configuration:

```sh
composedb composite:models my-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Ceramic node configuration

The local Ceramic node then needs to be configured to index documents using the models listed in the previous step.

This can be done by editing Ceramic's config file, which defaults to `~/.ceramic/daemon.config.json` on Linux, macOS and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), adding the necessary model stream IDs to the `indexing.models` array:

```json
{
  ...
  "indexing": {
    ...
    "models": ["..."]
  }
}
```
