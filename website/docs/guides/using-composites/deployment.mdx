# Composites deployment

Valid composites can be deployed to any supporting Ceramic node, by ensuring
the model streams described in the composite are available and indexed on the
node. An [admin DID](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx#generate-your-account) is necessary to start
indexing models on a Ceramic node.

:::caution Dependencies required

Make sure you have installed the packages imported in the code below before running the script.

:::

```js
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { readEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'
import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays/from-string'

// Hexadecimal-encoded private key for a DID having admin access to the target Ceramic node
// Replace the example key here by your admin private key
const privateKey = fromString('b0cb[...]515f', 'base16')

const did = new DID({
  resolver: getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(privateKey),
})
await did.authenticate()

// Replace by the URL of the Ceramic node you want to deploy the Models to
const ceramic = new CeramicClient('http://localhost:7007')
// An authenticated DID with admin access must be set on the Ceramic instance
ceramic.did = did

// Replace by the path to the local encoded composite file
const composite = await readEncodedComposite(ceramic, 'my-first-composite.json')

// Notify the Ceramic node to index the models present in the composite
await composite.startIndexingOn(ceramic)
```

:::caution Private key required

Running this command requires an [admin DID](../../set-up-your-environment.mdx#generate-your-account) private key to be
provided, using the `DID_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable or the `--did-private-key` flag.
