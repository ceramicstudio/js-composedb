# Composites discovery

ComposeDB does not yet provide a way to discover composites directly, however it is possible to create composites from known models.

## Models discovery

The ComposeDB CLI can be used to list the models indexed by 3Box Labs on the Clay network.

```sh
composedb model:list --table
```

## Creating a composite from known models

When models are available on a Ceramic network, it is possible to load them into a composite so they can be easily reused.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="api"
  groupId="api-or-cli"
  values={[
    {label: 'Using the CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Using the API', value: 'api'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="api">

Make sure you have the `composedb` packages [installed](../../installation.mdx), before running the code below.

```js
import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { Composite } from '@composedb/devtools'
import { writeEncodedComposite } from '@composedb/devtools-node'

const ceramic = new CeramicClient('https://gateway-clay.ceramic.network')
const composite = await Composite.fromModels({ ceramic, models: ['<model ID>'] })

await writeEncodedComposite(composite, 'my-composite.json')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```sh
composedb composite:from-model <model ID> --ceramic-url=https://gateway-clay.ceramic.network --output=my-composite.json
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
