# Queries

Access data stored on the network.

## Prerequisites

- Before your node can index your models, you need to deploy your composite.
- Before your client can perform queries on those models, you need to [compile your composite](../data-modeling/composites.mdx). [`ComposeClient`](../../api/classes/client.ComposeClient.md) automatically generates a GraphQL Schema from your compiled composite

## Basic queries

For our model, let’s say we have a `Post` Data Model:

```graphql
# Post model
type Post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple text post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  title: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 100)
  text: String! @string(maxLength: 500)
}
```

Now, query for posts:

```graphql
query {
  # Get first 2 posts
  postIndex(first: 2) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Where:

- `query` instructs GraphQL to perform a query
- `postIndex` is a built-in binding of your runtime composite. This binding enables us to look through the indexed data for a specific model and retrieve it.
- `(first: 2)` grabs the first 2 items that are indexed. You can also pass in `last: n` to get the last `n` number of items.
- The remainder of the query is standard GraphQL to retrieve the desired fields

## Querying relations

In [Relations](../data-modeling/relations.mdx) you learned how to write models with relationships to other models or accounts. Here we demonstrate how to query those relations. Unlike basic queries, when querying relations allows you to specify fields in a related model to be returned as fields of the original model.

### Model to model relations

For our models, let’s say we have a `Post` and we extend it by adding `Comments`.

```graphql
# Post model
type Post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple text post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  title: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 100)
  text: String! @string(maxLength: 500)
}
```

```graphql
type Comment @loadModel(id: "...") {
  id: ID!
}

# Extend Post model with comment relations
type Post @loadModel(id: "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96") {
  comments: [Comment] @relationFrom(model: "Comment", property: "postID")
}
```

Query for comments on posts:

```graphql
query {
  # Get first 5 posts
  postIndex(first: 5) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        text
        commentsCount
        # Get first 5 comments per post
        commentsIndex(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              text
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Account-to-Model

```graphql
# $id references the account DID string
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on CeramicAccount {
      postConnection(first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            text
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Model-to-Account

```graphql
# $id references a Post document stream ID
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ... on Post {
      # author is a CeramicAccount object
      author {
        id
        postConnection(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              text
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Things to Know

ComposeDB client automatically generates a GraphQL Schema from a compiled composite. It includes two objects: a  `CeramicAccount` object and a root `Query` object used as an entrypoint to access the graph.

### CeramicAccount Object

The `CeramicAccount` object replaces [`DID` scalars](../../api/sdl/scalars.mdx#did) in your composite with the following fields:

- `id: ID!`: the DID string value
- `isViewer: Boolean!`: whether the account authenticated to the Ceramic instance matches the `id`
- Other fields will be generated based on the models present in the definition

### Query Object

The `Query` object provides entrypoints for accessing data in the graph, using the following fields:

- `node(id: ID!): Node`: loads any `Node` (account or document) by its `id`
- `viewer: CeramicAccount`: the account attached to the Ceramic instance, if authenticated
- Other fields will be generated based on the models present in the definition, providing entry-points by querying the index
