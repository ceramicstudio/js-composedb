# Queries

Access data stored on the network.

## Prerequisites
---
- Installed ComposeDB client
- A compiled composite
- A deployed composite


:::tip
The ComposeDB Client automatically generates a GraphQL Schema from your compiled composite.

## Basic queries
---
For our model, let’s say we have a `Post` Data Model:

```graphql
# Post model

type Post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple text post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  title: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 100)
  text: String! @string(maxLength: 500)
}
```

Now, query for posts:

```graphql
# Get first 2 posts

query{
  postIndex(first:2){
		edges{
      node{
        title
				text
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Where:
- `query` instructs GraphQL to perform a query
- `postIndex` is a built-in binding of your runtime composite. This binding enables us to look through the indexed data for a specific model and retrieve it.
- `(first: 2)` grabs the first 2 items that are indexed.  You can also pass in `last: n` to get the last `n` number of items.
- The remainder of the query is standard GraphQL to retrieve the desired fields

## Querying relations
---
In [Relations](../data-modeling/relations.mdx) you learned how to write models with relationships to other models or accounts. Here we demonstrate how to query those relations. Unlike basic queries, when querying relations allows you to specify fields in a related model to be returned as fields of the original model.

### Querying model-to-model relations

For our models, let’s say we have a `Post` model and we extend it by adding a `Comments` model.

```graphql
# Post model

type Post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple text post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  title: String! @string(minLength: 10, maxLength: 100)
  text: String! @string(maxLength: 500)
}
```

```graphql
# Extend post model with comment relations

type Comment @loadModel(id: "...") {
  id
}

type Post @loadModel(id: "kjzl6hvfrbw6c99mdfpjx1z3fue7sesgua6gsl1vu97229lq56344zu9bawnf96") {
  comments: [Comment] @relationFrom(model: "Comment", property: "postID")
}
```

Query for comments on posts:

```graphql
# Get first 5 posts
# Get first 5 comments per post

query {
       postIndex(first: 5) {
         edges {
           node {
             title
             text
             commentsCount
             commentsIndex(first: 5) {
               edges {
                 node {
                   text 
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
```

### Querying account-to-model relations

```graphql
# $id references the account DID string
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ...on CeramicAccount {
      postConnection (first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            text
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Querying model-to-account relations

```graphql
# $id references a Post document stream ID
query ($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    ...on Post {
      author {
        id
        postConnection (first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              text
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Query filtering and sorting

Query filtering and sorting allows you to filter the query results based on specific fields and sort the results in a specified order.

### Query filtering

When building your application you might want to filter the query results based on a specific condition. There are two types of conditions you can define for filtering the documents:

- [value conditions](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#value-conditions)  - simple conditions that apply to a single field in a document
- [logical conditions](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#logical-conditions) - multiple conditions that create more complex filtering

#### Create indices

If you want a specific field in your data model to be used as a filter, you have to create an index for that specific field. This can be done using using `@createIndex` directive in your data model graphql schema.

For example, let’s say we would like to be able to filter the documents stored in the `Posts` model by fields `title`, `tag`, `ranking` and `created_at`. To define the indices for these fields we are going to update the model schema definition as follows:

```graph
type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "title"}])
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "tag"}])
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "ranking"}])
@createIndex(fields: [{path: "created_at"}])
{
    title: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    ranking: Int!
    created_at: DateTime!
}
```

We can then create some example data with different inputs by running a series of [mutations](./mutations.mdx#create-data) like the following:


*Query to create a post:*
```graphql
mutation CreatePosts($input: CreatePostsInput!){
  createPosts(input: $input){
    document{
      title
      body
      tag
      ranking
      created_at
    }
  }
}
```


*Input variable with content for the post:*
```json
{
  "input": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Let's talk about web3",
      "body": "This is my first tutorial covering web3",
      "tag": "tutorial",
      "ranking": 10,
      "created_at": "2023-07-11T10:02:08.190Z"
    }
  }
}
```

With indices defined and some data available we can now perform various queries with filters applied to specific fields.

#### Filter documents based on value conditions

ComposeDB enables you to filter documents based on specific [value conditions](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#value-conditions) applied to a specific field. Below is an example query that filters posts based on the post ranking. Key things to understand about the query in the example below:

- variable `input` of a type `PostsFiltersInput` allows the `postsIndex` to be filtered by a specified condition
- the `input` variable below defines the condition that is used to filter the documents. In this specific example, the query will return the documents that have a ranking greater than `8`.

*Query:*

```graphql
query MyQuery($input:PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters:$input, first:5){
    edges{
      node{
        title
        body
        created_at
		ranking
		tag
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Filtering condition:*

```json
{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "ranking":{
        "greaterThan": 8
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Let’s look at a few more examples of what queries with value conditions you can write. We will reuse the same query called `MyQuery` as above and will only modify the query conditions.

Return all documents where the field `tag` is not null:

```json
{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "tag":{
        "isNull": false
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Return all documents where the field tag has a value `tutorial` or `guide`:

```json
{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "tag":{
        "in": ["tutorial", "guide"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Return documents that were created after a specific date:

```json
{
  "input":{
    "where":{
      "created_at":{
        "greaterThan":"2023-05-12",
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Check out the reference for a full list of available [value conditions](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#value-conditions).

#### Filter documents using logical conditions

In addition to filtering documents based on values of a specific field, you might want to write more complex queries that would include logical conditions like `and`, `or` or `not`. 

This can be achieved by defining logical conditions like the example below. Here, we are using `and` logical condition in the input variable. This query will return the documents that have a tag `update` and were created before the date 2023-08-10:

*Query:*

```graphql
query MyQuery($input:PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters:$input, first:5){
    edges{
      node{
        title
        body
        created_at
        ranking
        tag
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Filtering condition:*

```json
{
  "input":{
    "and":[
      {
        "where":{
          "tag":{
            "equalTo":"update"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "where":{
          "created_at":{
            "lessThan":"2023-08-10"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Similarly, you can filter the documents based on a range of values. For example, let's say you would like to return the documents created between `2023-04-01` and `2023-08-01`:

```json
{
  "input":{
    "and":[
      {
        "where":{
          "created_at":{
            "greaterThenOrEqualTo":"2023-04-01"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "where":{
          "created_at":{
            "lessThanOrEqualTo":"2023-08-01"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note: the query above can also be written in a less verbose way as shown below. Under the hood, this filtering condition 
will use the same `and` logic as the example written above:

```json
{
  "input":{      
    "where":{
      "created_at":{
        "greaterThenOrEqualTo":"2023-04-01",
        "lessThanOrEqualTo":"2023-08-01"
      }
    }    
  }
}
```
Check out the [reference](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#logical-conditions) for more examples of how you can write queries with logical conditions.



### Sorting

Sorting allows you to sort the returned documents by a specified order - ascending, specified as `ASC`, or descending, speficied as `DESC`. For a field to be used for sorting the returned documents, it needs to have an index created just like we specified in [Create Indices](#create-indices) section of this guide.

Below is an example query that returns the document stored in a Posts model, filtered by a specified date and ordered in an ascending order based on the `title` field. Key things to understand about the query defined below:

- variable `sortinput` of a type `PostsSortingInput`  allows the postsIndex to be sorted using a specified ordering option.
- the `sortinput` variable below defines the field that will be used for sorting and the sorting order. In this example, the results will be sorted in an ascending order based on the `title` field.

Query:

```graphql
query MyQuery($input:PostsFiltersInput!, $sortinput:PostsSortingInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters:$input, sorting:$sortinput, first:5){
    edges{
      node{
        title
        body
        created_at
        ranking
        tag
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Filtering and sorting condition:

```json
{
  "input":{
    "where":{
      "created_at":{
        "greaterThan":"2023-05-12"
      }
    }
  },
  "sortinput":{
    "title":"ASC"
  }
}
```

Sorting documents by multiple fields is technically supported by ComposeDB, however, we don’t advice sorting documents by multiple fields as the order of which fields will be used for sorting cannot be guaranteed. 

Check out the reference for more details about [sorting](../../api/runtime/schema.mdx#sorting).


## Things to Know
---
ComposeDB client automatically generates a GraphQL Schema from a compiled composite. It includes two objects: a  `CeramicAccount` object and a root `Query` object used as an entrypoint to access the graph.

### `CeramicAccount` Object
The `CeramicAccount` object replaces [`DID` scalars](../../api/sdl/scalars.mdx#did) in your composite with the following fields:

- `id: ID!`: the DID string value
- `isViewer: Boolean!`: whether the account authenticated to the Ceramic instance matches the `id`
- Other fields will be generated based on the models present in the definition

### `Query` Object
The `Query` object provides entrypoints for accessing data in the graph, using the following fields:

- `node(id: ID!): Node`: loads any `Node` (account or document) by its `id`
- `viewer: CeramicAccount`: the account attached to the Ceramic instance, if authenticated
- Other fields will be generated based on the models present in the definition, providing entry-points by querying the index
