# ComposeDB roadmap

Since the launch of the ComposeDB Beta, the core Ceramic team remains committed to making ongoing improvements
to both ComposeDB and the underlying Ceramic protocol. Concurrently, we seek to involve the Ceramic developer
community in shaping Ceramic's future. We value your active participation in helping us prioritize the features 
and improvements that matter most to our developer base.

**All curent and future projects are outlined in the [Ceramic roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2).**

We welcome your feedback and insights on our roadmap priorities. You can show your support or express your concerns
about projects on the roadmap by upvoting or downvoting them. Additionally, we encourage you to leave more detailed 
comments, making suggestions or indicating relevant feature requests.
