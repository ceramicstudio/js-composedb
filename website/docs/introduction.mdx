## Overview
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3 app developers:

-  **Graph database** - Store and query data from a powerful graph, similar to Neo4j’s property graph database
-  **Easy to use** – Write your models as GraphQL schemas and connect your app using intuitive GraphQL APIs
-  **Data composability** – Reuse models from the marketplace to bootstrap your app with data, unlocking limitless data composability within ComposeDB’s open data ecosystem.
-  **Sign in with Web3** – Securely authenticate users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.
-  **Powered by Ceramic** – ComposeDB is built on Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality.

> For a complete introduction to ComposeDB concepts, see [Core Concepts](./core-concepts).

## Build powerful Web3 applications
ComposeDB on Ceramic powers Web3 applications and use cases, such as:

- Decentralized identity – profiles, credentials, reputation systems
- Social networks – social graphs, posts, likes, comments
- DAO tools – proposals, tasks, contribution graphs
- Information graphs – knowledge graphs, science graphs
- … and so much more
