# Core Concepts
Learn about the Core Concepts for ComposeDB:

**[Graph](./graph-structure.mdx)**
ComposeDB provides a graph structure for interacting with data on Ceramic, with two types of nodes: accounts & documents, and edges between nodes representing relations.

**[Models](./data-modeling-concepts.mdx)**
Streams of data on Ceramic are automatically tagged to Data Models, like profiles or blog posts, which in turn can have relations with other data models or be formed into groups of models called Composites. Models can be discovered through the Marketplace

**[Database](./database.mdx)**
ComposeDB is powered by a network of Ceramic nodes, with global state synced across. Today, you’ll need to run your own node to ensure data availability. You can query against your node using Ceramic’s native Client in GraphQL.
