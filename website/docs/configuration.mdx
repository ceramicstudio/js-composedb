# Ceramic configuration

Ceramic functionalities supporting ComposeDB are currently considered
experimental and the Ceramic node must be explicitly configured to support them.

## Environment variable

The `CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COMPOSE_DB` environment variable must be set to
`true` to run a Ceramic node with ComposeDB support, for example:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pnpm"
  groupId="package-manager"
  values={[
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```sh
CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COMPOSE_DB='true' npx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```sh
CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COMPOSE_DB='true' pnpm dlx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```sh
CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COMPOSE_DB='true' yarn dlx @ceramicnetwork/cli daemon
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Admin DIDs

ComposeDB queries support relies on Ceramic nodes indexing documents using the
models specified in the composite. In order to notify the Ceramic node of the
models to index, the ComposeDB tools need to interact with restricted admin APIs
on Ceramic.

Calling the Ceramic admin APIs requires an authenticated DID to be set in the
[configuration file](#configuration-file), which can be generated using the
following ComposeDB CLI commands:

### Generating a DID private key

The
[`did:generate-private-key` command](./api/commands/cli.did.md#composedb-didgenerate-private-key)
of the ComposeDB CLI can be used to generate a random private key for a DID:

```sh
composedb did:generate-private-key
```

:::caution

The generated private key must be securely stored so it can be used when
interacting with other commands of the ComposeDB CLI when set as the
`DID_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable or `--did-private-key` flag, and
development tools APIs.

:::

### Getting the DID value

The DID string value can be accessed based on a known private key generated in
the step above by using the
[`did:from-private-key` command](./api/commands/cli.did.md#composedb-didfrom-private-key)
of the ComposeDB CLI:

```sh
composedb did:from-private-key [hexadecimal-encoded private key string]
```

The DID string can then be set in the Ceramic node configuration file as
described below.

## Configuration file

The Ceramic node configuration file, which defaults to
`~/.ceramic/daemon.config.json` on Linux, macOS and WSL (Windows Subsystem for
Linux), needs to be edited to specify the [admin DIDs](#admin-dids) allowed to
set models for indexing, as well as the indexing configuration:

```json
{
  ...
  "http-api": {
    ...
    "admin-dids": ["did:key:..."]
  },
  "indexing": {
    ...
    "allow-queries-before-historical-sync": true
  }
}
```

:::tip

If your Ceramic node is already started, it will need to be restarted for the
changes to the configuration file to be applied.
