# Welcome to ComposeDB!!

## Overview
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3 app developers:

-  **Graph database -** Store and query data from a powerful graph, similar to Neo4j’s property graph database

-  **Easy to use –** Write your models as GraphQL schemas and connect your app using intuitive GraphQL APIs

-  **Data composability –** Reuse models from the marketplace to bootstrap your app with data, unlocking limitless data composability within ComposeDB’s open data ecosystem.

-  **Sign in with Web3 –** Securely authenticate users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.

-  **Powered by Ceramic –** ComposeDB is built on Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality.
