# Sandbox

Test out several pre-made example queries below to gain hands-on exposure to accessing documents by relations, filtering and ordering by fields, and combining query logic.

For a deeper dive into querying, visit the [**queries**](./docs/0.5.x/guides/data-interactions/queries) page.

## Data Models

---

The schema definitions that this sandbox uses are outlined in [**this repository**](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo/tree/main/composites). The sandbox has been pre-populated with data corresponding to several fictionary people.

### Instructions

To interact with the ComposeDB Sandbox, simply press the pink play icon to execute the pre-written queries in the left-hand side of the embedded GraphiQL IDE. Results returned from your query will populate in the right-hand side of the interface.

You can also alter your query logic however you see fit, or build your own queries entirely from scratch based on the schema definitions.

_Please note that this sandbox only processes read requests._

## Reading Profiles

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `BasicProfile` model:



<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='profiles' /></div>

<br />
---

## Reading Posts

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Posts` model:



<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='posts' /></div>

<br />
---

## Reading Comments

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Comments` model:


<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='comments' /></div>


<br />

## Next Steps

To begin building with ComposeDB in your local environment using the same data models you just queried, get started [**Setting Up Your Environment**](./docs/0.5.x/set-up-your-environment).
